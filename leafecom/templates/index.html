<div style="padding:30px;">
	<p>This site has been moved from a crufty old Rackspace virtual machine to my shiny new <b><a href="http://digitalocean.com/" target="_new">Digital Ocean</a> droplet</b>. I'd really love to start this site from scratch, but I really don't have the time. So yeah, it kinda sucks. I <i>do</i> put a little time into writing my <a href="https://blog.leafe.com">blog</a>, so you might want to check that out.</p>
	
	<p>As a result, there may be some parts that have not been converted yet, so please bear with me. If you notice something that doesn't work as it should, please let me know: either send an email to ed at leafe dot com, or DM me on Twitter: @EdLeafe.</p>
	
	<p>Thanks for your patience!</p>
